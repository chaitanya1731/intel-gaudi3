  - context: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerator has a total capacity of 128 GB of HBM
      memory called HBM2e (High-Bandwidth Memory 2 Enhanced) memory. This is a
      significant upgrade from Intel® Gaudi® 2. The Intel® Gaudi® 3 HBM memory
      has 8 stacks of HBM2e packages with 16 GB per stack. There is a high-bandwidth
      connection between each of the dies. The total bandwidth of the Intel®
      Gaudi® 3 HBM memory peaks at 3.7 TB/s.

          There are 8 stacks of HBM2e packages.
  - context: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 processor has 96 MB of SRAM memory per chip. It is divided
      into two dies of 48 MB each that is integrated into each Intel® Gaudi® 3
      processor package. The on-board SRAM memory acts like a single package with
      a peak bandwidth of 19.2 TB/s. The on-die 96 MB of SRAM can be used as a
      uniformly accessible last-level cache (L3) or split to 4 slices of 24 MB L2
      cache each, with each slice accessible to 2 MMEs and 16 TPCs.
