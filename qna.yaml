  - question: What is Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI Accelerator and what type of AI workloads it can handle?
    answer: |
      Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI Accelerator is the next generation AI accelerator from Intel and Habana Labs.
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 accelerator was designed to provide state-of-the-art datacenter performance
      for all AI workloads, from generative applications such as large language models (LLMs) and
      diffusion models (image generation such as Stable Diffusion) to standard object recognition,
      classification, and voice dubbing.
  - question: |
      What is the primary architectural advancement in the Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerator
      compared to its predecessor Intel® Gaudi® 2 AI accelerator?
    answer: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerator advances from the Intel® Gaudi® 2 accelerator's
      7nm process to a 5nm process, providing improved area density and power efficiency.
  - question: What are the two main compute engines of Intel® Gaudi® 3 accelerator?
    answer: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 accelerator features two main compute engines:
      the Matrix Multiplication Engine (MME), responsible for operations like fully connected layers and convolutions,
      and the Tensor Processor Core (TPC) cluster, which accelerates non-GEMM deep learning operations.
  - question: What are the main components of Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerator?
    answer: |
      Intel® Gaudi® 3 AI accelerator includes - PCIe Gen5 X16 port, a Scheduling and Synchronization Unit,
      8 Matrix Multiplication Engines (MMEs), 64 Tensor Processor Cores (TPCs), 14 Media Decoder Engines (DECs),
      4 Rotator Engines (ROT), 24 Network ports with an RDMA Engine, 96 MB of L2 Cache, and 128 GB of HBM2e memory.
  - question: How much SRAM is on a Intel Gaudi 3 accelerator?
    answer: Each Gaudi 3 accelerator has 96MB of on die SRAM
  - question: How much memory does each Intel® Gaudi® 3 processor have?
    answer: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3  chip has two types of memory.
      There is 128GB of HBM memory within the package that has a bandwidth of 3.7 TB/s
      and also has 96 MB of SRAM memory that is on-die and is 12.8 TB/s.
  - question: What kind of PCIe bus does an Intel® Gaudi® 3 use?
    answer: |
      Each Intel® Gaudi® 3 processor uses a PCIe Gen5 x16 bus which has a theoretical bandwidth of 63.04 GB/s
      which is double the bandwidth of the previous generation.
      It uses a Dual-slot PCIe that is full height and 10.5” in length.
  - question: How many media decoders does an Intel® Gaudi® 3 have?
    answer: |
      The Intel® Gaudi® 3 increases its media decoders from 8 in the previous generation to 14 in the Intel® Gaudi® 3 generation. 
      There are 14 total media decoders. 
      For video, each media decoder is capable of HEVC with up to 10 profiles at a max resolution of 8192x8192. 
      The media decoders are also capable of a Progressive H.264 & SVC base layer & MVC up to 4096x4096 resolution. 
      The Intel® Gaudi 3® media decoders also support the VP9 profile up to profile 2 (10-bit) at a max resolution of 8192x8192. 
      For the image formats it is capable of JPEG and Progressive JPEG up to an 8192x8192 resolution.
